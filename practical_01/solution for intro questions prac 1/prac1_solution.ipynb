    "Python is a programming language that has been growing in popularity in recent years. There are many reasons for this, but it mostly comes down to Python being easy to learn and use as well as the fact that Python has a very active community that develops amazing extensions to Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has become one of the most frequently used languages in the world of data science due to the ability to almost instantly apply it to a large number of data science problems. When asking companies in different industries and of various sizes what lanuage they would like their data scientists to know when coming in, they almost all agree that Python is the best choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of you have had experience in Java. Both share many characteristics given they are both programming languages and many structures and concepts will be familiar. However, there are differences. You may find you prefer python and it may allow you to be more productive, not just because of the provision of many libraries which implement Data Mining algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some key differences between Python and Java are:\n",
    "- Python is dynamically typed while Java is statically typed, this has various implications including you never need to declare variables in Python\n",
    "- Python code is more concise (briefer)\n",
    "- Python is more compact\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following program is in Java:\n",

One of the benefits is that it allows you to write in plain text to create, what should feel like, a notebook. The closest analog here would be to relate an IPython notebook to a typical lab notebook kept by \"traditional\" researchers. Anyone coming from chemistry or biology will probably understand what I mean.\n",
